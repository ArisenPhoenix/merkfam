## Created With [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) AND Reactjs - Of Course

# Contents
- Games (self-made)
- Blogs (Unfinished): this is a TODO it needs a connection to a database
- Home (Empty): Don't Know What To Add As A Splash Screen At The Moment.
- My Own Pacakge - Still Under Development And Is Named As Merkurial in the files. It's Not Clean Nor Does It Have A Specified Purpose Yet. Mostly A Utility of Things I Use Most Commonly Now.
- Finances (Unfinished) - Will Be Used To Manage Family Finances - When I Have Time To Get Around To It.


# Running This:
- Fork
- Edit Whatever Info You Like
- Deploy To Vercel Using Whatever Method You Like - Personally I like to connect vercel to my GitHub so updates are made automatically upon pushing.
- ENVS Are Only 1 at this time NEON_DB_URL which takes a connection string for a postgre database. this will be found in the Merkurial/SQL/QUERY Function. MongoDB Syntax Kills Me So I Prefer Using SQL For Backends Nowadays.
